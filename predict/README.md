## Overview

The **Predict** folder contains all the necessary code and resources for the prediction functionalities of the BlockPredict project. This includes algorithms, data processing scripts, and models used to generate predictions based on blockchain data.

## Folder Structure

Here's an overview of the folder's structure:

```plaintext
predict/
├── models/                # Pre-trained models and training scripts
│   ├── model1/            # Model 1 specific files
│   └── model2/            # Model 2 specific files
├── data/                  # Data processing scripts and datasets
│   ├── raw/               # Raw datasets
│   └── processed/         # Processed datasets ready for use
├── scripts/               # Prediction scripts and utilities
│   ├── predict.py         # Main prediction script
│   └── utils.py           # Utility functions for prediction
└── README.md              # This README file
```

## Installation

To get started with the prediction functionalities, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the predict folder**:
    ```bash
    cd predict
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Running Predictions

To generate predictions using the pre-trained models:

1. **Prepare your data**: Ensure your data is in the correct format and placed in the `data/processed/` directory.

2. **Run the prediction script**:
    ```bash
    python scripts/predict.py --model model1 --input data/processed/input_data.csv --output results/predictions.csv
    ```
    Input processing is taken cared by server, as this script runs as a child process.
