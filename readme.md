## Installation

To get started with the BlockPredict project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/devharshthakur/blockpredict.git
    cd blockpredict
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**: We use `pnpm` as our package manager for its speed and efficiency.
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Client

To start the frontend client application:

```bash
cd client
pnpm start
```

### Running the Server

To start the backend server application:

```bash
cd server
pnpm start:dev # to start in devolopment(watch) mode
```

### Running Blockchain Scripts

To deploy and interact with smart contracts:

```bash
cd blockchain
pnpm hardhat node
# In a diff terminal
pnpm hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
